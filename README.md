# FSharp Workshops

## Format 

2-hour meeting every week (thursday?) at end of work day (14:00-16:00?) 
"Talk" means only a presentation (may include live coding/examples?).
Talks could be made 1-hour only, so that noone falls asleep.
"Workshop" means short introductory presentation (~15mins) and the rest of time is working in pairs, preferably with a prepared guided script (such as in the Machine Learning Digit Recognizer workshops). 

Another idea is to combine talk and workshop, e.g. make a 1-hour presentation, and then 1.5-hour workshop covering the same material. First introductory meeting would only be talk, but starting with 2nd meeting it would be talk and workshop combined.
