# FSharp Workshops

## Format 

2-hour meeting every week (thursday?) at end of work day (14:00-16:00?) 
Idea is to combine talk and workshop, e.g. make a 45-min presentation, and then 1.5-hour workshop covering the same material. First introductory meeting would only be talk, but starting with 2nd meeting it would be talk and workshop combined.
